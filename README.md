# Zod Actions ⚒️

**IMPORTANT: uncompleted abandoned proyect, don't use**

I started this library as a way to built forms integrating SvelteKit's FormActions and Zod validation.
Then i realized that there is already an already made library with the same idea, better done and tested than mine: SuperForms
So i decided to archive this proyect, was a fun journey anyways. 

Please use --> https://superforms.rocks

## Install (i would not do  it)
~~~bash
npm i zod-actions (please, dont do it)
~~~
